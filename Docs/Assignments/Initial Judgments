#Initial judgments on collected IDs

#Looking at anti_join table: 

#DISCARD: 
#apple0 is a test. blank responses. did not do raw5. 
#0 is a test. blank responses. only appears in raw6. 
#3squash1230. actual participant (filled out demographic info/raw6). but no subsequent tests. 
#TEST-SE is a test. blank responses. only appears in raw6. 
#The rest of the ID's that start with "apple" or "aplpe" are test. they only appear in raw6 (demographics--given at beginning), and not found in subsequent tests.
#l is a test. only appear in raw6.
#TEST-SE is a test. blank responses. only appear in raw6. 

#KEEP: 
#1pepper1630. actual participant. appears everywhere except raw5 (last study). 

#CONCERN: 
#Ignore the "NA" IDs? I think they appeared when using rbind to make the table (have "NA" in empty cells). 




#Duplicate IDs table:
#DISCARD:
#blank ids appear 28 times in raw6. they are all tests. 
#test appears 11 times in raw6. they are all tests. 

#KEEP
#1grape1230 appears twice. it is two different participants (because of different demographic data). We are able to tell them apart because they both have different dates under the "Date" column (which is present in each raw file). 
#3grape1230 appears twice. same issue as 1grape1230--can differentiate based on date. 
#5grape1230 appears twice. same issue as above--can differentiate based on date. 

#CONCERN: 
#trialmorningc3 appears twice. All of the "trialmorning" IDs have different demographic data (indicating different participants), but they are most likely trials since there is "trial" in the name. Maybe it was a pilot study? 





#HOW TO FIX (EXAMPLES)

#Use this to change name of ID
raw1[raw1$dg1=='5aprciot1100',"dg1"]='5apricot1100'

#Use this to discard entire row
raw6=raw6[!(raw6$dg1=='0'),]
