#Initial judgments on collected IDs

#Looking at anti_join table: 

#DISCARD: 
#apple0 is a test. blank responses. did not do raw5. 
#0 is a test. blank responses. only appears in raw6. 
#3squash1230. actual participant (filled out demographic info/raw6). but no subsequent tests. 
#TEST-SE is a test. blank responses. only appears in raw6. 
#The rest of the ID's that start with "apple" or "aplpe" are test. they only appear in raw6 (demographics--given at beginning), and not found in subsequent tests.
#l is a test. only appear in raw6.
#TEST-SE is a test. blank responses. only appear in raw6. 

#KEEP: 
#1pepper1630. actual participant. appears everywhere except raw5 (last study). 

#CONCERN: 
#Ignore the "NA" IDs? I think they appeared when using rbind to make the table (have "NA" in empty cells).
