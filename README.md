# Assignment1-CleanTrust
Cleaning raw data files from a project about trust and social cues

These data were collected in a lab experiment during Fall 2015 and Winter 2016. The goal is to write R code to consolidate various raw files into a single file with clean data. 
(Side topic: what is "clean" data?)


Here are some of the required sub-tasks:

-- locating and using ID variables to link cases from different raw files

-- resolving discrepancies (e.g. ID was typed wrong in the data collection phase, requiring manual correction in our code)
 -- possible such cases: 1grape1230, 3grape1230, 5grape1230

-- creating useful variable names and a key linking those names to the full items (e.g. "How many hours of sleep did you get last night?" is the full item and the variable name is "sleep")

-- useful formatting for each variable's data and a key linking this to the source (e.g. participant responses were to a likert scale from "1--strongly disagree to 7--strongly agree" and our data analysis requries just the numeric values)
